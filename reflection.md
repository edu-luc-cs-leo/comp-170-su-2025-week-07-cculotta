My version leans on Python’s built-ins and simple string splits (using sum(), min(), max(), and a sentence-based .split(". ") approach for brevity), whereas the reference solution trades conciseness for explicitness by manually accumulating statistics in a single-pass loop with an empty-list guard and building each markup line word-by-word with rest.isalpha() checks. The result is that my code is shorter and still passes the tests, but the solution’s more defensive style makes edge-case handling (empty inputs, non-alphabetic tokens) crystal-clear and educational for practicing core control-flow and validation.
